</Steps>

</Warning>

## Step 2: Create a Discord Bot

If you've never created a Discord bot before, don't worry - it's easier than you think!

### 2.1 - Access Discord Developer Portal

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Log in with your Discord account
3. Click the **"New Application"** button in the top right
4. Give your application a name (e.g., "My FiveM Server Bot")
5. Click **"Create"**

### 2.2 - Create the Bot

1. In your new application, click **"Bot"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Add Bot"** button
3. Click **"Yes, do it!"** to confirm
4. You now have a Discord bot!

### 2.3 - Get Your Bot Token

<Warning>
**Never share your bot token with anyone!** It's like a password for your bot. If someone else gets it, they can control your bot.
</Warning>

1. Under the bot's username, you'll see a **"TOKEN"** section
2. Click **"Reset Token"** (or "Copy" if this is a fresh bot)
3. Click **"Yes, do it!"** to confirm
4. Click **"Copy"** to copy your bot token
5. **Save this token** - you'll need it for the configuration

### 2.4 - Configure Bot Permissions

Your bot needs specific permissions to function properly:

1. Scroll down to **"Privileged Gateway Intents"**
2. Enable the following intents:
   - ✅ **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT** (required)
   - ✅ **PRESENCE INTENT** (optional, but recommended)
   - ✅ **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** (optional)
3. Click **"Save Changes"** at the bottom

### 2.5 - Invite Bot to Your Server

Now we need to add the bot to your Discord server:

1. Click **"OAuth2"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"URL Generator"** under OAuth2
3. Under **"SCOPES"**, check:
   - ✅ `bot`
4. Under **"BOT PERMISSIONS"**, check:
   - ✅ `Read Messages/View Channels`
   - ✅ `Read Message History`
5. Copy the generated URL at the bottom
6. Paste it in your browser and select your Discord server
7. Click **"Authorize"**
8. Complete the captcha if prompted

Your bot is now in your server! You should see it in your member list (offline for now).

## Step 3: Get Your Discord Server ID

You need your Discord server's Guild ID for the configuration:

1. Open Discord
2. Go to **User Settings** (gear icon)
3. Go to **Advanced** (under "App Settings")
4. Enable **"Developer Mode"**
5. Close settings
6. Right-click your Discord server icon
7. Click **"Copy Server ID"**
8. **Save this ID** - you'll need it for configuration

## Step 4: Configure the Script

Now that you have your bot token and server ID, let's configure the script:

1. Open the `jx_discord` folder
2. Open `config.lua` in a text editor
3. Find these lines:

```lua
Config.Token = '' -- Your Discord Bot Token
Config.Guild = '' -- Your Discord Guild/Server ID
```

4. Paste your bot token and server ID:

```lua
Config.Token = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE'
Config.Guild = 'YOUR_SERVER_ID_HERE'
```

### Additional Configuration Options

Here are all the configuration options explained:

#### Discord Requirements

```lua
Config.RequireDiscord = true -- Kick players without Discord linked
```
- **true**: Players must have Discord linked to their FiveM account
- **false**: Players can join without Discord (data won't be available)

```lua
Config.RequireInGuild = true -- Kick players not in Discord server
```
- **true**: Players must be in your Discord server to join
- **false**: Players don't need to be in the server (but need Discord linked if `RequireDiscord` is true)

```lua
Config.KickMessage = 'You must be in our Discord server to play. Join: discord.gg/yourserver'
```
- Customize the message shown when players are kicked
- Replace `discord.gg/yourserver` with your actual Discord invite link

#### Auto Cache Management

```lua
Config.RefreshCacheOnConnect = true
```
- **true**: Refresh player Discord data every time they connect (recommended)
- **false**: Use cached data (faster but may be outdated)

#### Webhook Logging

```lua
Config.LogWebhookURL = '' -- Discord Webhook URL for connection logs
```

To enable connection logging:

1. Go to your Discord server
2. Right-click the channel where you want logs
3. Click **"Edit Channel"**
4. Click **"Integrations"**
5. Click **"Create Webhook"**
6. Give it a name (e.g., "Connection Logs")
7. Click **"Copy Webhook URL"**
8. Paste it in the config:

```lua
Config.LogWebhookURL = 'https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL'
```

Leave it empty (`''`) if you don't want connection logging.

## Step 5: Add to server.cfg

Almost done! Now we just need to tell your FiveM server to start the resource:

1. Open your `server.cfg` file
2. Add this line:

```cfg
ensure jx_discord
```

**Important**: Make sure this line is added **after** any framework resources (ESX, QBCore, etc.) but can be anywhere else.

Example server.cfg order:
```cfg
ensure es_extended  # or qb-core
ensure oxmysql

ensure jx_discord  # Add here

ensure your_other_resources
```

## Step 6: Start Your Server

1. Start (or restart) your FiveM server
2. Watch the console for the JX Discord API startup message
3. You should see colored `[JX_Discord]` messages indicating successful startup

### Verify Installation

To verify everything is working:

1. Join your FiveM server
2. Check the server console - you should see your Discord data being loaded
3. If you configured a webhook, check your Discord channel for a connection log

### Successful Installation Indicators

You'll know it's working if you see:
- Green `[JX_Discord]` messages in console (not red errors)
- Player Discord data appearing in console (if enabled)
- Webhook logs in Discord (if configured)
- Players without Discord getting kicked (if `RequireDiscord` is enabled)

## Troubleshooting Installation Issues

### "Invalid Bot Token" Error

**Symptoms**: Red error about HTTP 401 or "Unauthorized"

**Solutions**:
- Double-check your bot token in the config
- Make sure you copied the entire token (no extra spaces)
- Try resetting your bot token in the Discord Developer Portal
- Ensure the token is inside the quotes: `Config.Token = 'YOUR_TOKEN'`

### "Cannot Find Guild" or HTTP 403 Error

**Symptoms**: Errors about missing permissions or guild not found

**Solutions**:
- Verify your Guild ID is correct
- Make sure your bot is actually in your Discord server (check the member list)
- Ensure the bot has the **SERVER MEMBERS** intent enabled
- Try removing and re-inviting the bot with the correct permissions

### "Player Has No Discord" But They Do

**Symptoms**: Players with Discord linked are being kicked

**Solutions**:
- Make sure players have Discord linked in FiveM (not just open)
- Ask players to restart FiveM completely
- Verify `Config.RequireDiscord` and `Config.RequireInGuild` settings
- Check if player's Discord account is actually in your server

### Bot Appears Offline

**Symptoms**: Bot shows as offline in Discord

**Solutions**:
- This is normal! The bot doesn't need to be "online" to work
- As long as the FiveM server is running, the bot is functional
- The bot makes API calls without maintaining a persistent connection

### No Webhook Logs Appearing

**Symptoms**: Webhooks configured but no logs showing

**Solutions**:
- Verify the webhook URL is correct and complete
- Make sure the webhook channel still exists
- Check if the webhook was deleted in Discord
- Ensure the URL starts with `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/`

## Next Steps
