## What It Does

Bridge your FiveM server with Discord to:

- Verify player Discord accounts are linked
- Enforce Discord server membership
- Check player roles for permissions/VIP systems
- Retrieve usernames, avatars, and role data
- Log player connections via webhooks
- Automatic caching for performance
