# Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring JX VIP System from start to finish. Follow each step carefully to ensure everything works properly.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- ✅ FiveM server with the latest artifacts
- ✅ Basic knowledge of FiveM resource installation
- ✅ Access to your server files and server.cfg
- ✅ Discord server (for VIP role integration)

---

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

JX VIP System requires two dependencies to function properly.

### 1.1 - Install ox_lib

**ox_lib** is a modern utility library used for the UI and caching system.

1. Download the latest release from [Overextended GitHub](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases)
2. Extract the `ox_lib` folder to your `resources` directory
3. Add to your `server.cfg` **before** jx_vip:
   ```cfg
   ensure ox_lib
   ```

### 1.2 - Install JX Discord API

**JX Discord API** is required for Discord role verification.

1. Download JX Discord API (from our releases)
2. Extract the `jx_discord` folder to your `resources` directory
3. Follow the [JX Discord API installation guide](../discord-api/installation) to set it up
4. **Important**: Configure your Discord bot and add your VIP role IDs
5. Add to your `server.cfg` **after** ox_lib but **before** jx_vip:
   ```cfg
   ensure jx_discord
   ```

**Note**: JX Discord API must be fully configured and working before JX VIP System will function!

---

## Step 2: Download JX VIP System

1. Download the latest version of JX VIP System
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. You should see a folder named `jx_vip` or `JX_VIP`
4. Rename it to exactly `jx_vip` (lowercase, with underscore)
5. Place the `jx_vip` folder in your `resources` directory

**Important**: The folder **must** be named `jx_vip` exactly. The script won't work if renamed!

---

## Step 3: Configure Discord Roles

Now we need to tell the VIP system which Discord roles grant VIP access.

### 3.1 - Get Your Role IDs

1. Open Discord
2. Go to **User Settings** → **Advanced**
3. Enable **Developer Mode**
4. Go to your Discord server
5. Right-click your VIP role → **Copy ID**
6. Repeat for VIP+ role (or create one if you don't have it)

### 3.2 - Add Role IDs to Config

1. Open `jx_vip/shared/config.lua`
2. Find the `Config.Discord` section:

```lua
Config.Discord = {
    vipRoles = {
        '1348940524089905174', -- Regular VIP role ID
        '1348940524089905174'  -- VIP+ role ID
    }
}
```

3. Replace with your actual role IDs:

```lua
Config.Discord = {
    vipRoles = {
        '123456789012345678', -- Your VIP role ID
        '987654321098765432'  -- Your VIP+ role ID
    }
}
```

**Important**: The first role ID is considered "VIP" and the second is considered "VIP+". If you only have one VIP tier, you can use the same ID twice.

---

## Step 4: Framework Configuration

JX VIP System supports ESX, QBCore, QBX, and standalone modes.

### 4.1 - Auto-Detection (Recommended)

By default, the system will automatically detect your framework:

```lua
Config.Framework = 'auto'
```

The detection priority is: ESX → QBCore → QBX → Standalone

### 4.2 - Manual Selection (Optional)

If auto-detection doesn't work, manually specify your framework:

```lua
-- For ESX
Config.Framework = 'esx'

-- For QBCore
Config.Framework = 'qbcore'

-- For standalone (no framework)
Config.Framework = 'standalone'
```

---

## Step 5: Configure Items (Optional)

If you're using a framework with inventory, you may need to configure items.

### 5.1 - Check Default Items

The VIP shop comes pre-configured with these items:
- `bread` (food)
- `water` (drink)
- `bandage` (medical)
- `lockpick` (VIP+ exclusive)
- `repairkit` (VIP+ exclusive)

### 5.2 - Verify Items Exist

Make sure these items exist in your inventory/database:

**ESX**: Check `items` table in database  
**QBCore**: Check `qb-core/shared/items.lua`  
**Standalone**: Items won't work without a framework

### 5.3 - Customize Items (Optional)

To change shop items, edit the `Config.Shop.items` section in `config.lua`:

```lua
Config.Shop = {
    enabled = true,
    currency = 'money', -- or 'bank' or 'black_money'
    items = {
        vip = {
            {name = 'sandwich', label = 'Sandwich', price = 50, count = 5, icon = 'bread-slice'},
            -- Add more items...
        },
        vip_plus = {
            {name = 'sandwich', label = 'Sandwich (VIP+)', price = 25, count = 10, icon = 'bread-slice'},
            -- Add more items...
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Step 6: Skin Menu Configuration (Optional)

If you want the clothing menu feature to work, configure your skin system.

### 6.1 - Auto-Detection (Recommended)

Default setting automatically detects your skin menu:

```lua
Config.SkinMenu = 'auto'
```

Supported systems (in detection order):
- illenium-appearance
- qb-clothing
- esx_skin
- skinchanger
- fivem-appearance
- codem-appearance
- ag_appearance

### 6.2 - Manual Selection (Optional)

If you have multiple skin systems or auto-detection fails:

```lua
-- For illenium-appearance
Config.SkinMenu = 'illenium-appearance'

-- For qb-clothing
Config.SkinMenu = 'qb-clothing'

-- For esx_skin
Config.SkinMenu = 'esx_skin'

-- etc.
```

### 6.3 - Disable Clothing Feature

If you don't have a skin system or don't want this feature:

```lua
Config.Features.clothing_menu = {
    enabled = false, -- Disable the feature
    -- ... rest of config
}
```

---

## Step 7: Add to server.cfg

Now we need to ensure the resource starts properly.

### Correct Start Order

Add these lines to your `server.cfg` in this exact order:

```cfg
# 1. Start framework (if using one)
ensure es_extended  # or qb-core

# 2. Start oxmysql (if using database)
ensure oxmysql

# 3. Start ox_lib (required)
ensure ox_lib

# 4. Start JX Discord API (required)
ensure jx_discord

# 5. Start JX VIP System
ensure jx_vip

# 6. Your other resources
ensure your_other_resources
```

**Important**: ox_lib and jx_discord **must** start before jx_vip!

---

## Step 8: Start Your Server

1. Save all configuration files
2. Start (or restart) your FiveM server
3. Watch the console for startup messages

### Successful Installation

You should see green messages like:
```
[JX_VIP] Successfully loaded!
[JX_VIP] Framework: ESX
[JX_VIP] Skin Menu: illenium-appearance
[JX_VIP] VIP features initialized
```

### Installation Errors

If you see red error messages:
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Verify resource name is exactly `jx_vip`
- Make sure ox_lib and jx_discord started first
- Review console errors for specific issues

---

## Step 9: Test the System

### 9.1 - Give Yourself VIP Role

1. Go to your Discord server
2. Give yourself one of the VIP roles you configured
3. Make sure you're in the Discord server

### 9.2 - Join Server

1. Join your FiveM server
2. Wait a few seconds for Discord data to load

### 9.3 - Open VIP Menu

1. Press **F5** (default keybind)
2. VIP menu should open
3. You should see your VIP status and available features

### 9.4 - Test a Feature

1. Try using "Full Heal" or another cheap feature
2. You should receive a notification on success
3. Check console for any errors

---

## Step 10: Customize (Optional)

Now that the basic system is working, you can customize:

### Features

Edit feature prices, cooldowns, and requirements in `config.lua`:

```lua
Config.Features = {
    heal = {
        enabled = true,
        price = 500,      -- Change price
        cooldown = 300,   -- Change cooldown (seconds)
        vipLevel = 'vip', -- Change required level
        -- ...
    }
}
```

### Shop

Add, remove, or modify shop items:

```lua
Config.Shop.items.vip = {
    {name = 'newitem', label = 'New Item', price = 100, count = 1, icon = 'box'},
    -- Add your items...
}
```

### Teleport Locations

Add custom teleport destinations:

```lua
Config.QuickTravel.locations = {
    {name = 'My Custom Location', coords = vector3(x, y, z), price = 200},
    -- Add more locations...
}
```

### UI Colors

Change the primary color scheme:

```lua
Config.Menu = {
    title = 'VIP Menu',
    subtitle = 'Exclusive features',
    position = 'top-right', -- or 'top-left', 'center'
    keybind = {
        key = 'F5' -- Change keybind
    }
}
```

## Common Installation Issues

### "Resource not found"

**Problem**: Server can't find jx_vip resource

**Solution**:
- Ensure folder is named exactly `jx_vip`
- Check it's in the `resources` directory
- Verify `ensure jx_vip` in server.cfg

---

### "Dependency missing: jx_discord"

**Problem**: JX Discord API not installed or not started

**Solution**:
- Install JX Discord API first
- Add `ensure jx_discord` before `ensure jx_vip` in server.cfg
- Restart server

---

### "ox_lib not found"

**Problem**: ox_lib not installed or not started

**Solution**:
- Download and install ox_lib
- Add `ensure ox_lib` before `ensure jx_vip` in server.cfg
- Make sure it's named exactly `ox_lib`

---

### VIP Menu Doesn't Open

**Problem**: Pressing F5 does nothing

**Solutions**:
1. Check console for errors
2. Try `/vipmenu` command instead
3. Verify player has VIP role in Discord
4. Wait 10 seconds after joining for Discord data to load
5. Check if another resource is using F5 keybind

---

### "No VIP Roles Detected"

**Problem**: Script says player has no VIP roles

**Solutions**:
1. Verify role IDs are correct in config
2. Make sure player has the role in Discord
3. Ensure player is in the Discord server
4. Check JX Discord API is working (use exports to test)
5. Try leaving and rejoining the FiveM server

---

### Features Don't Work

**Problem**: Features show in menu but don't work

**Solutions**:
1. Check server console for errors
2. Verify framework is detected correctly
3. For vehicle features, ensure player is in a vehicle
4. Check if player has enough money
5. Look for cooldown timer

---
